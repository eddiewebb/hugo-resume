# hugo Resume

Created from [Start Bootstrap - Resume](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/resume/).
This is basically a single-page website with auto-scrolling based on left-hand nav.  Dedicated project/publications pages allow more detail.  Includes a client-side search powered by fuse.js at '/search' but currently theme does not link to that anywhere.  Includes an `/admin` endpoint that can allow authorized users to use a WYSIWYG editor and commit files back to markdown, but with a Wordpress/CMS like experience.

## Setup & Use

This theme uses a combination of a custom archetype `projects` and some data files to drive content.

You can test the provided [exampleSite](exampleSite) after cloning with the command:
`cd exampleSite;hugo -t hugo-resume --themesDir ../.. server`

### Summary
Edit the main `contents/_index.md with a brief bio/summary`

### Data files
Data files are used for simple content presented on the homepage.

- [data/skills.json](https://github.com/eddiewebb/hugo-resume/blob/master/exampleSite/data/skills.json)
- [data/experience.json](https://github.com/eddiewebb/hugo-resume/blob/master/exampleSite/data/experience.json)
- [data/education.json](https://github.com/eddiewebb/hugo-resume/blob/master/exampleSite/data/education.json)


### Projects
Initially projects were in their own JSON file too, but I decided I wanted to allow more detail and custom formatting.
Projects are added to one of 2 subfolders of `creations` or `contributions`. The difference indicates your role as originator or collaborator.   Use `hugo add projects/TYPE/name-of-project.md` to leverage the proper archetype.

### Publications
Similar to projects, create them under `publications`. Include any papers, speaking engagements, articles, etc.

### Blog / Posts
Similar to posts, create them under `blog`. Include any thoughts, musings, etc.
**This template does not support a `posts` folder**

### Template params

All personal information outside the above details is captured by params in [`config.toml`](https://github.com/eddiewebb/hugo-resume/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml), or can be edited in the "Settings" collection if using CMS.

### Internationalization

Left navigation menu and section titles handle multiple languages. Use `defaultContentLanguage` parameter un [`config.toml`](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/) to choose your language. Current supported languages are :
- `en`
- `fr`

## CMS Editor with Netlify CMS
**Does not require deployment to Netlify!**

[Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) is an open source project that enables CMS like experience for static site generation tools like Hugo. This theme includes a fully working integration and guide in [exampleSite/static/admin](https://github.com/eddiewebb/hugo-resume/blob/master/exampleSite/static/admin)
